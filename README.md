# Refugee Literacy Project

## Introduction

"Refugee Literacy Project" is a project aimed at addressing the pressing issue of limited literacy skills among some refugees in Europe. The project recognizes the critical role that literacy plays in a person's life, influencing integration, access to opportunities, and overall well-being. Through this initiative, we aspire to **develop a highly accessible digital resource to support analphabetic adults in acquiring fundamental literacy skills**, thus enabling them to rebuild their lives with confidence in a new and unfamiliar environment.

## Features

- Multilingual Learning: Access learning materials in various languages commonly spoken by refugees in Europe, ensuring an inclusive learning experience.
- LetterIntroduction and Phonics: Master the alphabet, letter sounds, and blending through interactive exercises, crucial for foundational literacy skills.
- Vocabulary Building: Expand vocabulary with essential words related to daily life, using interactive flashcards and audio pronunciation.
- Culturally Relevant Content: Learn from culturally sensitive examples and stories that resonate with the experiences of refugees in Europe.
- Accessibility: The app provides audio recordings and an intuitive visual design to ensure accessibility for learners with varying literacy levels.
  Getting Started
